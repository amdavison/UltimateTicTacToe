# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

This is a creative spin on a classic game. Instead of playing on a single board of 9 spaces, you have 9 local boards that make up a main board. The first player gets to choose any position to start. Whichever block in that local board is played on, that is the next local board that must be played. Once a local board is won, or completed by a tie, it is locked out with the winner taking that main board block. If a player is sent to a locked board, they may choose any available position.
